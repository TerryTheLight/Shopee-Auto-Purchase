# Shopee-Auto-Purchase

Auto purchase using typescript that will automatically purchase 
any link paste on the <b>urlToApply variable.<b>

<b>NOTE:<b>
1). This is a super early version of the code where best practices are
not implemented. Used urgently to snatch some stuff in shopee :D

2). Paste the whole code in a google chrome extensions called Tampermonkey
to execute the code. The code will only run on webpage that are applied to the <b>urlToApply variable<b>

3). Whether the code will work or not is subject to Shopee updates and change in flow
